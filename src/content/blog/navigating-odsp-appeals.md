## Understanding ODSP Appeals

If your ODSP application is denied or your benefits are reduced, you have the right to appeal the decision.

## Two-Stage Appeal Process

### Stage 1: Internal Review

First, you must request an internal review:

- **Timeline**: Within 30 days of receiving the decision
- **Process**: Submit written request to your local ODSP office
- **Review**: ODSP supervisor reviews the decision
- **Duration**: Usually 30-60 days

### Stage 2: Social Benefits Tribunal

If the internal review doesn't resolve the issue:

- **Timeline**: Request within 30 days of internal review decision
- **Process**: Submit appeal to Social Benefits Tribunal
- **Hearing**: You'll attend a hearing to present your case
- **Duration**: Can take 6-12 months
